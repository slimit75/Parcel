# Parcel
Parcel is a script to simplify the distribution of updates for an addon aircraft for X-Plane.

It (probably can't right now, but will): 
- [ ] Clean up & remove files from development (`.ignore` files, source files, files from IDEs & more)
- [ ] Automatically generate a zip file for download 
- [x] Automatically generate files for the [Skunkscraft Updater](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/406-skunkcrafts-updater/)

It will be intended to run as a part of an automated CI process, but currently won't. Do not run this in your main project folder, only run it in a duplicated version!
